            <h1>Parent PLUS Repayment Options</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">Understanding your choices</p>
        </header>

        <section class="content">
            <h2>When Repayment Starts</h2>
            <p>Parent PLUS loans enter repayment as soon as the loan is fully disbursed.</p>
            <p>However, parents can request a <strong>deferment</strong> while the student is enrolled at least half-time, plus an additional 6 months after the student graduates or drops below half-time.</p>

            <div class="callout warning">
                <h3>Important</h3>
                <p>Interest accrues during deferment. If you don't pay it, it will capitalize when deferment ends, increasing your total balance.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Standard Repayment Plan</h2>
            <p>This is the default option.</p>

            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed monthly payment</li>
                <li>10-year repayment term</li>
                <li>Pays off the loan fastest</li>
                <li>Minimizes total interest paid</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Example</h3>
            <p>$40,000 Parent PLUS loan at 8% interest:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Monthly payment: ~$485</li>
                <li>Total paid over 10 years: ~$58,200</li>
                <li>Total interest: ~$18,200</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Who It's For</h3>
            <p>Parents who can afford the monthly payment and want to pay off the loan as quickly as possible.</p>

            <h2>Graduated Repayment Plan</h2>
            <p>Payments start low and increase every 2 years.</p>

            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Payments start lower than standard</li>
                <li>Increase every 2 years</li>
                <li>Still a 10-year term</li>
                <li>Costs more in interest than standard</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Who It's For</h3>
            <p>Parents who expect their income to increase over time and need lower payments now.</p>

            <h2>Extended Repayment Plan</h2>
            <p>Stretches repayment to 25 years.</p>

            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed or graduated payments</li>
                <li>25-year term</li>
                <li>Lower monthly payment</li>
                <li>Significantly more interest paid</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Example</h3>
            <p>$40,000 Parent PLUS loan at 8% interest:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Monthly payment: ~$309</li>
                <li>Total paid over 25 years: ~$92,700</li>
                <li>Total interest: ~$52,700</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Who It's For</h3>
            <p>Parents who need the lowest possible monthly payment and are willing to pay significantly more in interest.</p>

            <h2>Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR)</h2>
            <p>The only income-driven option for Parent PLUS loans, but it requires consolidation first.</p>

            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Must consolidate Parent PLUS loans into a Direct Consolidation Loan</li>
                <li>Payment is 20% of discretionary income</li>
                <li>Remaining balance forgiven after 25 years</li>
                <li>Forgiven amount is taxable income</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Catch</h3>
            <p>ICR payments are often higher than standard repayment because they're based on the parent's income, not the student's.</p>
            <p>It's most useful for parents with low income relative to their debt.</p>

            <h3>Example</h3>
            <p>Parent with $50,000 income and $40,000 in Parent PLUS loans:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Monthly payment: ~$300-400 (varies by family size)</li>
                <li>After 25 years, remaining balance is forgiven</li>
                <li>Forgiven amount is taxed as income</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Consolidation</h2>
            <p>You can consolidate multiple Parent PLUS loans into a single Direct Consolidation Loan.</p>

            <h3>Benefits</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Single monthly payment</li>
                <li>Access to ICR repayment plan</li>
                <li>Potential eligibility for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Drawbacks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Unpaid interest capitalizes</li>
                <li>Weighted average interest rate (rounded up to nearest 1/8%)</li>
                <li>Resets the clock on PSLF progress (if you had any)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)</h2>
            <p>Parent PLUS loans can qualify for PSLF, but only after consolidation.</p>

            <h3>Requirements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Consolidate into a Direct Consolidation Loan</li>
                <li>Enroll in ICR repayment</li>
                <li>Work full-time for a qualifying employer (government or nonprofit)</li>
                <li>Make 120 qualifying payments</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Who It's For</h3>
            <p>Parents who work in public service and have high debt relative to income.</p>

            <h2>Deferment and Forbearance</h2>

            <h3>Deferment</h3>
            <p>Temporarily pause payments while the student is in school or during economic hardship.</p>
            <p>Interest continues to accrue.</p>

            <h3>Forbearance</h3>
            <p>Temporarily pause or reduce payments due to financial difficulty.</p>
            <p>Interest continues to accrue.</p>
            <p>Limited to 12 months at a time, 3 years total.</p>

            <div class="callout warning">
                <h3>Use Sparingly</h3>
                <p>Deferment and forbearance increase your total debt because interest keeps accruing. Use them only when absolutely necessary.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Should You Refinance?</h2>
            <p>Private lenders offer refinancing for Parent PLUS loans, often at lower interest rates.</p>

            <h3>Benefits</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Lower interest rate (if you qualify)</li>
                <li>Lower monthly payment or faster payoff</li>
                <li>Can transfer loan to student's name (some lenders)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Drawbacks</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Lose federal protections (deferment, forbearance, forgiveness)</li>
                <li>Requires good credit</li>
                <li>Variable rates can increase over time</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Comparing Your Options</h2>
            <p>Use the calculator to model different scenarios:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What if I pay extra each month?</li>
                <li>Should I consolidate and use ICR?</li>
                <li>Is refinancing worth losing federal protections?</li>
                <li>How much will I save by paying off early?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Next Steps</h2>
            <p>Before choosing a repayment plan, have <a href="family-conversation.html">the family conversation</a> about who will actually be making the payments. Then <a href="calculator.html">use the calculator</a> to compare your options.</p>

            <h2>What Is a Parent PLUS Loan?</h2>
            <p>A Parent PLUS loan is a federal student loan that <strong>parents</strong> take out to help pay for their child's education.</p>
            <p>It's not a student loan. It's a parent loan.</p>

            <h2>How Parent PLUS Loans Are Different</h2>

            <h3>1. The Parent Is the Borrower</h3>
            <p>The loan is in the parent's name. The parent is legally responsible for repayment.</p>
            <p>The student is not a co-signer. The student has no legal obligation to repay it.</p>

            <h3>2. Higher Interest Rates</h3>
            <p>Parent PLUS loans have higher interest rates than undergraduate student loans.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Parent PLUS: ~8% (as of 2024)</li>
                <li>Undergraduate Direct Loans: ~5-6%</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Higher Fees</h3>
            <p>Parent PLUS loans have an origination fee of ~4% of the loan amount.</p>
            <p>If you borrow $10,000, you'll pay a $400 fee upfront, but you still owe $10,000.</p>

            <h3>4. No Borrowing Limits (Except Cost of Attendance)</h3>
            <p>Parents can borrow up to the full cost of attendance minus any other financial aid the student receives.</p>
            <p>This can be dangerous—there's no cap based on ability to repay.</p>

            <h3>5. Credit Check Required</h3>
            <p>Unlike student loans, Parent PLUS loans require a credit check. If the parent has adverse credit history, the loan may be denied.</p>

            <div class="callout warning">
                <h3>The Big Difference</h3>
                <p>Student loans are based on the student's future earning potential. Parent PLUS loans are based on the parent's current financial situation—often when they're nearing retirement.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Who Qualifies?</h2>
            <p>To qualify for a Parent PLUS loan, the parent must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Be the biological or adoptive parent (or sometimes stepparent)</li>
                <li>Not have an adverse credit history</li>
                <li>Have a child enrolled at least half-time in an eligible school</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>When Do Parents Take Out PLUS Loans?</h2>
            <p>Common scenarios:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The student has maxed out their federal student loan limits</li>
                <li>The family doesn't qualify for enough need-based aid</li>
                <li>The parents want to avoid private student loans</li>
                <li>The student doesn't have credit history for private loans</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Hidden Costs</h2>

            <h3>Interest Accrues Immediately</h3>
            <p>Unlike subsidized student loans, interest starts accruing the day the loan is disbursed.</p>
            <p>There's no grace period. Repayment starts immediately (though you can defer while the student is in school).</p>

            <h3>No Income-Driven Repayment (Mostly)</h3>
            <p>Parent PLUS loans don't qualify for most income-driven repayment plans.</p>
            <p>The only option is Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR), and only if you consolidate into a Direct Consolidation Loan first.</p>

            <h3>Limited Forgiveness Options</h3>
            <p>Parent PLUS loans don't qualify for most loan forgiveness programs.</p>
            <p>Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) is possible, but only after consolidation and 10 years of qualifying payments.</p>

            <h2>The Emotional Complexity</h2>
            <p>Parent PLUS loans create a unique dynamic:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Parents feel obligated to help their children</li>
                <li>Students feel guilty that their parents are in debt</li>
                <li>Families avoid talking about the financial reality</li>
                <li>Resentment can build on both sides</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="callout">
                <h3>The Unspoken Expectation</h3>
                <p>Many parents take out PLUS loans with the informal expectation that the student will help repay them after graduation.</p>
                <p>But legally, the student has no obligation. This can create tension if the student can't or won't help.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Should Parents Take Out PLUS Loans?</h2>
            <p>It depends. Questions to ask:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Can we afford the monthly payments?</li>
                <li>Will this jeopardize our retirement?</li>
                <li>Are there other options (scholarships, work-study, community college)?</li>
                <li>Is the degree likely to lead to a job that justifies the debt?</li>
                <li>Have we had an honest conversation with our child about expectations?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Alternatives to Parent PLUS Loans</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Student works part-time</strong> – Reduces borrowing need</li>
                <li><strong>Student takes a gap year to save</strong> – Delays college but reduces debt</li>
                <li><strong>Student attends a less expensive school</strong> – Community college, in-state public school</li>
                <li><strong>Private student loans in student's name</strong> – Requires credit or co-signer, but shifts legal responsibility</li>
                <li><strong>Home equity loan</strong> – Lower interest rate, but puts home at risk</li>
            </ul>
